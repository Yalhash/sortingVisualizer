# sortingVisualizer (Work In Progress)
#TODO:  
-add more sorting algorithms  
-clean up the code, move around the video class  

Current Alogorithms:
>bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort

A program to create .mp4 videos of sorting algorithms working on given images

This is done using stb_image to import an image, and ffmpeg to encode the final video.  
This program works best with small images, as it sorts by position, so the size of the array being sorted is the length by width  

Thanks to Dmytro Dovzhenko for the VideoCapture class
